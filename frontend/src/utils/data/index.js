        'Bend one leg at the knee. Choose the leg you are going to fold in first. If your left leg is your standing leg, keep your left foot planted on the ground, and slowly bend in your right leg at the right knee so that the sole of your right foot rests against your left inner thigh (known as the half-lotus position in Bikram yoga). Point the knee of your bent leg outward, away from your body.',
        'Lengthen your body. Clasp your hands together in Anjali Mudra (also called the “prayer position”)',

Press the tailbone toward the pubis and lift the pubis toward the navel. Narrow the hip points. Firm but don’t harden the buttocks.',
        'Firm the shoulder blades against the back, puffing the side ribs forward. Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back. Distribute the backbend evenly throughout the entire spine.',
        'Hold the pose anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds, breathing easily. Release back to the floor with an exhalation.',

        'On an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels toward the floor. Straighten your knees without locking them.',
        'Firm your outer arms and press the bases of your index fingers actively into the floor. Lift along your inner arms from the wrists to the tops of the shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them toward your tailbone. Keep your head between your upper arms.',

Press firmly into the palms using them as leverage to lift onto the balls of the feet and extend one leg up. Bend at the elbows, place your hands on your low back creating a shelf, and then extend the next leg up.',
        "Once you raise the legs, don't turn your head to the side to look around the room, since you can injure your neck. Keep your gaze upward and your neck straight.",

        "Move your hips toward the front of the room and your feet toward the back of the room to straighten the body. The correct alignment is with the hips over the shoulders and feet over the hips. Ask your teacher or a friend to help you determine if your legs are perpendicular to the floor.",
